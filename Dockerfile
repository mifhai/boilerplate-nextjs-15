#   Next.js collects completely anonymous telemetry data about general usage, so always disable 
#   telemetry during the build and runtime, by setting ENV NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1
# - https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/config/next-config-js/output
#   Automatically leverage output traces to reduce image size, where file server.js is created 
#   by next build from the standalone output.
